# DonorsChoose.org - Predicting Donation Funding Success 

**Background** - Founded in 2000 by a Bronx history teacher, DonorsChoose.org has raised $685 million for America's classrooms. Teachers at three-quarters of all the public schools in the U.S. have come to DonorsChoose.org to request what their students need, making DonorsChoose.org the leading platform for supporting public education.

To date, 3 million people and partners have funded 1.1 million DonorsChoose.org projects. But teachers still spend more than a billion dollars of their own money on classroom materials. To get students what they need to learn, the team at DonorsChoose.org needs to be able to connect donors with the projects that most inspire them.

**Problem** - Since it's inception, 22.6% of all projects posted on DonorsChoose.org did not receive sufficient funding. Once a project is submitted on DonorsChoose.org, DonorsChoose.org has no way of knowing whether the project will receive sufficient funding or not. 

**Project Goal** - To build an ML Model that can predict whether a submitted project will receive full funding or not. DonorsChoose.org can use this model to: 

* Proactively differentiate between projects that are more likely to receive sufficient funding vs. projects that have a low likelihood to receive sufficient funding. 
* Suggest edits/improvements on project proposals that have a low likelihood of receiving sufficient funding
* Market/promote the projects that have a lower likelihood of receiving  funded sufficient more on the website, etc.
